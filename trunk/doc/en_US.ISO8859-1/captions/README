$FreeBSD: doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/captions/README,v 1.1 2010/01/30 21:45:07 murray Exp $

This directory holds closed captions for audio and video recordings of
technical presentations about FreeBSD.

The expected hierarchy is :

doc/${LANG}/captions/${YEAR}/${CONFERENCE}/${TALK}

e.g.

doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/captions/2009/asiabsdcon/mckusick-kernelinternals.sbv

Individual captions are currently stored as YouTube 'sbv' files which
are simple ASCII text files with timing and transcription information.
